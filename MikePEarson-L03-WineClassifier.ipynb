    "Your task for this assignment:  Design a simple, low-cost sensor that can distinguish between red wine and white wine.\n",
    "Your sensor must correctly distinguish between red and white wine for at least 95% of the samples in a set of 6497 test samples of red and white wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your technology is capable of sensing the following wine attributes:\n",
    "- Fixed acidity  \n",
    "- Free sulphur dioxide\n",
    "- Volatile acidity  \n",
    "- Total sulphur dioxide\n",
    "- Citric acid  \n",
    "- Sulphates\n",
    "- Residual sugar  \n",
    "- pH\n",

    "1. What is the percentage of correct classification results (using all attributes)?\n",
