They say that using this baseline, a conversion to psychosis is predicted with 93% accuracy when low semantic density and talk about voices are used as variables to predict psychosis. “Low semantic density” means that there is a poverty of content in the speech of a person – their talk does not have a high or complex meaning. The researchers used the New York Times corpus (N=13,592) as semantic probes to search for meaning. They used k-means clustering to find words that had common meaning and sentiment. Of particular predictive value were words that emphasized auditory perception – voice, hear, chant, whisper, utter. Some of the words (example: whisper) were never spoken by the subjects, but were implied in the meaning (derived from the vector unpacking). The study used 40 participants in  a longitudinal study. I think the k-means clustering was a good technique for this particular investigation, since it found a sort of common-sense indicator of psychosis: the focus on voices and auditory hallucinations. As a tool for mental health professionals, this seems promising – but a sample size of 40 subjects is small. Further study with individuals who agree to be recorded and have their statements analyzed is a warranted to see if this method is statistically valid.
